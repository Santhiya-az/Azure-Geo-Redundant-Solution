# Azure Geo-Redundant Solution with Path-Based Routing  
## Overview  
This project demonstrates the creation of a secure, globally distributed infrastructure using Azure. It involves setting up a geo-redundant solution to optimize content delivery and enhance performance by directing user traffic to the closest location based on path-based routing.

## Objectives  
✅ Set up a geo-redundant infrastructure for high availability and performance  
✅ Configure path-based routing to separate and optimize traffic for images and dynamic content  
✅ Improve response times and ensure fault tolerance using load balancing and traffic management  

## Files Included  
- **Azure_Geo_Redundant_Solution_Steps.docx** – Step-by-step documentation of the solution architecture and configuration  
- **Azure_Geo_Redundant_Solution_Screenshots.docx** – Supporting screenshots of the deployment and routing configuration  

## Tools & Technologies  
- Azure IaaS  
- Azure Load Balancer  
- Azure Application Gateway  
- Traffic Manager  
- Path-Based Routing  
- Network Security  
- Virtual Machines Deployment  

## Key Results  
✔️ Enhanced global performance with faster content delivery  
✔️ Optimized traffic flow using path-based routing  
✔️ Increased infrastructure reliability with geo-redundancy  
✔️ Seamless user experience with minimal latency  

## How to Use  
1. Follow the steps in the documentation file to replicate the setup.  
2. Refer to the screenshots for visual guidance on configuration.  
3. Adjust the routing rules and network settings as needed for your environment.  

## Future Enhancements
